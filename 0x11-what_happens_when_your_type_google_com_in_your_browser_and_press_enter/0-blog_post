As a Full-stack Developer software Engineer, here are the threads of processes that happens:
```
When type in your browser and press Enter, several things happen:

1. Your browser sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to look up the IP address associated with (link unavailable)
2. The DNS server responds with the IP address of a Google server (e.g., 116.58.194.200).
3. Your browser establishes a connection to the Google server using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol.
4. Your browser sends an HTTP request to the Google server, specifying the desired resource (in this case, the Google homepage).
5. The Google server processes the request and generates an HTML response, which includes the content of the webpage, such as text, images, and links.
6. The Google server sends the HTML response back to your browser.
7. Your browser receives the response and renders the webpage, displaying the Google homepage with its search bar, logo, and other elements.

This all happens rapidly, usually in a matter of milliseconds!!!.
